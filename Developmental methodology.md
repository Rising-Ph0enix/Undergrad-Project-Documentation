# Development methodology chosen for IoT solution â€“ high level:

### 1. Specify and design complex IoT systems using a lightweight IoT-A methodology

Papyrus for IoT uses an IoT-A based methodology to guide the IoT system designer during the system development. The methodology is generic and independent from any product. It consists of five steps as shown in Figure 1.

**Step 1** : Design the purpose and requirements of the system using UML use case diagrams and SysML requirements diagrams.

**Step 2** : Define the process specification. The use cases of the IoT system are formally described, based on and derived from the purpose and requirements specification.

**Step 3** : Define the functional architecture of the system based on the IoT domain model.

**Step 4** : Define the operational platform on which the functional system will be executed.
The operational view of the system contains information about computing devices (eg. Raspberry PI, Intel Edison, ST Cortex, etc.), sensors, actuators and communication protocols (eg. Wifi, Ethernet, Zigbee, etc).

**Step 5** : Define deployment plans that include information on the allocation of functional blocks (step 3) to operational ones (step 4).
