Requirements elicitation and analysis:

#Pro-tip: Avoid DOGMA &amp; USE WHAT WORKS FOR YOU...!

**Definition** :

An activity within requirements development that identifies sources for requirements and then uses techniques such as **interviewing, prototyping, facilitated workshops, and documentation studies** to gather requirements from these sources

Purpose:

Prioritize and progressively elaborate stakeholder and solution requirements in order to enable the project team to implement a solution that will meet the needs of the sponsoring organization and stakeholders

Process:

Step 1:

**Understand the sources you will tap for requirements** , including stakeholders and physically accessible references (e.g., documentation, manual procedures, polices, and so on). To identify your stakeholders, look for people within these categories: the sponsor, product champions, direct and indirect users, advisers, and suppliers. Consider their interests, concerns, and success criteria, and remember that not all stakeholders are equal. Stakeholder analysis provides useful information about which requirements elicitation techniques are best for your situation.

Step 2:

**Elicit requirements &amp; analyze as you elicit**
