### "passing JSON object from android to server"

Google that & read ... (covers the android side of interface)
Link: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/35390928/how-to-send-json-object-to-the-server-from-my-android-app 
1. POST methods:

i. gps data: (get at ETM side)
ii. ticket info (bus route no, current stop, destination stop)  // Just collect these 3 at your ETM side.

Get all of the above separately - finally after pressing OK button,

Put all of that into a JSON object dynamically... and send it to server.


### Server:

You now need to cover the server side of Receiving JSON object.

Define API with 2 functions:

// Start Small. - send the gps data initially along with the ticket

1. GET methods:

i. gps data:
ii. ticket info (bus route no, current stop, destination stop)  // Just collect these 3 at your ETM side.

Get a JSON object - than put all of that into the database....! :)

// Do SERVER SIDE PROCESSING - Ticket information - calculate the no of LIVE tickets...

2. POST methods:  (Do you Need to specify a POST method in your API??)

Get the LIVE tickets and send it back either as a string or a JSON object to the android app.
