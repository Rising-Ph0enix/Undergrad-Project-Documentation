To do:

1) Break the ETM w. Wireless subsystem into smaller capabilities

TNSTC ETM w. Wireless -&gt;  Develop a simple app that simultates the ETM with a Issue ticket button â€“ everything is simulated except no tickets are printed (Good for proof of concept) -&gt; Develop a basic app with just one button that sends a bluetooth signal to the bluetooth module of the Location tracking module.

2) Understand how the TNSTC ETM works - &gt; Whether it has GPS / GPRS enabled in it..? + Inner working
