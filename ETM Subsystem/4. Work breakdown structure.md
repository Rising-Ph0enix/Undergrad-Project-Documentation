#Work Breakdown structure

| S. No. | Phase | **Work** | Sub task 1 | Sub task 2 | Sub task 3 | Sub task 4 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Analysis | Take a TNSTC Electronic Ticketing Machine and fit it with wireless capabilities. | Get a TNSTC ETM for rent / for loan / ask to use it for some time / get a spare | Understand how TNSTC ETM works | Study list of IoT wireless connectivity protocols and tabulate their pros &amp; cons – Filter some which are suitable for your application |   |
|   |   |   |   | Determine whether the ETM has GSM/GPRS/GPS capabilities |   |   |
|   |   |   |   | Check if adding wireless capabilities to the device is feasible |   |   |
|   | Design |   |   |   | Choose the protocol which is ideal list by priority which are feasible &amp; suitable for your application |   |
|   |   |   |   |   | Choose the protocol &amp; capability which is most feasible for application. |   |
|   | Implementation |   |   |   |   | Develop a basic app with just one button that sends a bluetooth signal to the bluetooth module of the Location tracking module( **Proof of concept** ) |
|   |   |   |   |   |   | Develop a simple app that simultates the ETM with a Issue ticket button – everything is simulated except no tickets are printed |
|   |   |   |   |   |   | Learn how to add your wireless capability with existing ETM (consult ECE dept at K univ) |
|   |   |   |   |   |   | Do it!! |
