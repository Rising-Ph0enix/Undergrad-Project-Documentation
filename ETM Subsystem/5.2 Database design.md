#Database design: (with sample data)

**ETM side:**

| **Bus Route No.** | **List of stops on route** | **Corresponding number on keypad** | **Current Stop** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 16J | Airport | 1 | Airport |
|   | Avaniapuram | 2 |   |
|   | Villapuram | 3 |   |
|   | Therku vassal | 4 |   |
|   | Narimedu | 5 |   |
|   | Krishnapuram Colony | 6 |   |
|   | Thapal Thanthi Nagar | 7 |   |

**Cloud PaaS side: (need for matching of data)**

| **Bus route No.** | **List of stops on route** | **Current stop** | **Ticket Destination List Count** | **Location (in lat &amp; long)** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 16J | Airport | Avaniapuram |   | (37.5,96.9) |
|   | Avaniapuram |   |   |   |
|   | Villapuram |   | 7 |   |
|   | Therku vassal |   | 3 |   |
|   | Narimedu |   | 10 |   |
|   | Krishnapuram Colony |   | 8 |   |
|   | Thapal Thanthi Nagar |   | 6 |   |

**Note:** Idea is whenever the current stop gets updated to call a function that removes the count of all the tickets where (destination stop==current stop)

# Now I'm using Mongo db...!

# Here's the JSON for my server side database:

{
    "_id" : ObjectId("58b14f702f09608c8e552215"),
    "RouteNo" : "16J",
    "Ticket" : [ 
        {
            "From" : "Airport",
            "To" : "Avaniapuram"
        }, 
        {
            "From" : "Airport",
            "To" : "Narimedu"
        }
    ],
    "Latitude" : 9.83859,
    "Longitude" : 78.089522
}
