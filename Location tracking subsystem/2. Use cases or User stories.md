# Use Cases

1) The conductor presses OK button, <Current Stop, Destination Stop, Bus Route ID> is sent wirelessly to the Location Tracking Subsystem (on-board computer). The Location Tracking Subsystem receives the Ticket Data (stores in temporary memory?) & sends the data to the server via GSM / GPRS when the on-board computer is not relaying the GPS information (every 10 seconds).
