**User Stories for Cloud back-end processing script /program**

**NOTE: I&#39;m skipping callback the KEY feature of Javascript for now…v 0.0.1**

**Note: The database design for the cloud server is similar to ETM ** 

1. 1)An ETM (Electronic Ticketing Machine) sends the GPS co-ordinates in the form of a JSON object – with key-value pairs of latitude and longitude to the server via a HTTP Post request (alternatives checking) – every 10 seconds.
2. 2)The same ETM sends some ticket information on okButtonClick by conductor. A JSON object consisting of key-value pairs of {Bus Route ID, Current stop, Destination stop} is dynamically created and sent to cloud server IP that is listening on a specific port number. The okbuttonClick does NOT occur at the same time of gps sending
3. 3)Scenario 2 but the okbuttonClick occurs at the same time of gps sending – the gps sending thread is blocked for one second and sent immediately after the okbuttonClick information is sent to server.
4. 4)A separate thread is calculating the live ticket (crowd) information every time ticket information is received. NOTE: Everything is done on a single thread in javascript – so same thread…
5. 5)The Track My Bus android app client sends a request with Bus route ID. The Live Ticket information (crowd ) along with the latitude , longitude is composed as a JSON object dynamically &amp; it is sent to the client app
