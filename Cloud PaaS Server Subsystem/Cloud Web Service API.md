# Cloud Web Service

1. AWS 

2. AppFog

Some good paas which support python...

One more IaaS or Paas?

Use the above idea:

=> First decide which language etc. etc. & then based on your requirements you can choose a PaaS

Other question:

What is the Cloud script going to do?

Its just going to maintain a database of bus , crowd information etc.

Based on the request of the app, it will return the corresponding location + crowd info - that's all its going to do

Only qn location - coordinates - > server - co-ordinates/stop? -> 

Use geocoding in client / app end OR use it in server end??
